### Risk Management
- A primary goal of an organization is to protect assets. 
- An **asset** is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
- Assets can be digital or physical, such as data, software, hardware, or intellectual property.
- Common strategies used to manage risk:
  - **Acceptance:** Accepting a risk to avoid disruption to business operations.
  - **Avoidance:** Creating a plan to avoid the risk entirely.
  - **Transference:** Shifting the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company.
  - **Mitigation:** Reducing the risk by implementing security controls.

### Today's most common threats, risks and vulnerabilities
- **Threats:** Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
  - **Insider Threats:** Employees or contractors who misuse their access to an organization's assets.
  - **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** Sophisticated attacks that target specific organizations.
- **Risks:** The likelihood of a threat occurring and impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
  - **External Risks:** Threats from outside the organization, such as malware or phishing attacks.
  - **internal Risks:** Threats from within the organization, such as employee errors or malicious insiders.
  - **Legacy Risks:** Risks associated with outdated systems or software.
  - **multiparty Risks:** Risks that arise from third-party vendors or partners.
  - **Software Risks:** Risks associated with vulnerabilities in software.
